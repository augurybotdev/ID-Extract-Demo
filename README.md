# OCR-based ID Scraper

This repository contains a prototype for an OCR-based ID Scraper using Streamlit and Tesseract. The prototype demonstrates the extraction of key data points from an example ID image and presents them in a structured format. Next Steps would involve placing the information into an editable form for the user to ensure that the extracted text reflects their information.

## Concept
The core idea is to allow users to extract specific information fields from ID images (like driver's licenses). The current implementation focuses on demonstrating the concept with a predefined example image provided by the Department of Homeland Security.

## Future Implementation

For a production-ready microservice, several considerations and improvements would be necessary:

Scalability: Integration with cloud services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to handle large-scale requests.

Accuracy: Enhancing OCR accuracy by preprocessing images, such as noise reduction, binarization, and skew correction.

Support for Multiple IDs: Developing templates for different types of IDs, considering variations across states and countries.

Security: Implementing encryption and ensuring GDPR compliance for handling personal data. Also, adding features like data retention
policies and secure data deletion.

Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid or unreadable images.

User Interface: A more intuitive and user-friendly interface, possibly with guided steps or tooltips.

API Endpoints: Instead of a web UI, offering API endpoints for other services to use directly.

**Data Validation**: Post-OCR validation to ensure extracted data's correctness and completeness.

**Localization**: Support for multiple languages and regional ID formats.

## Steps for a Viable Microservice

Research & Template Creation: Understand different ID formats and create templates for data extraction.

**Image Preprocessing**: Implement image preprocessing steps to improve OCR accuracy.

Data Extraction & Validation: Extract data using OCR and validate it against predefined templates.

Security Measures: Ensure end-to-end encryption and secure data handling.

Integration: Offer API endpoints and integrate with other systems if needed.

Testing: Rigorous testing with diverse ID samples to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Deployment: Deploy as a scalable cloud-based service of provide to client for which this idea was created to demonstrate working knowledge and ability to execute.

## Notes

While the current implementation serves as a proof of concept, turning this into a professional, reliable micro-service requires thorough research, rigorous testing, and multiple iterations to ensure it's accuracy and continued reliability.
